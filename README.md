# VR-Test-World

This is a practice world I created to try out my skills in VR. I used the XR package 
in unity to create this and worked in a lot of my own script to get a lot of it working 
how i wanted it to work. 

This is a great example of my abilities to learn and adapt. After making this i feel 
confident i could integrate a lot of what i have done here with the other game mechanics
I have made to create a VR game. 

How To Play:
VR equipment needed.
Controls are on separate hands. 
Left touch pad allows you to move and strafe.
Right touch pad will turn you. 
Right touch pad UP will allow you to teleport on trigger pull.
Grip buttons to grab.
Trigger to interact.


What is programmed:
-Wall climbing: was not something that came with the XR kit so i had to put that together
 myself. I'm happy with the result as you need to crouch down to climb over the edge.

-Camera and display: This was a mechanic i wanted to play with and making a VR world allowed
me to have more fun with it. I hope to expand on this and create the ability to take pictures 
that will save to the game file and hopefully expand to recording short clips with it. 

-SnapPoints: these were included with the XR kit but i expanded them to work the way i 
wanted them to work. so you could create hat drop points and a tool belt. I imagine at
some point I am going to create an inventory using these on a backpack item. 

-Blowing: This was simple enough to implement. I could easily expand this to include a 
scoring system and make more of a bowling game from it. It's actually quite fun just to play
it in VR and it can be hard to pull away from it.
